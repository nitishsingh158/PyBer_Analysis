# PyBer  - Analysis of a Rideshare App

### Overview of the project 
The project analyses rede transactional data from a popular ride-sharing app. The analysis sorts the data by city type and draws insights from key metrics such as driver count, ride count, and average fare for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. 

### Results of the analysis
The table below provides a quick description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. Some of the key observations are:
1. Urban cities constitute 68% of total rides taken during a week through PyBer. 
2. Urban cities make up 62% of the revenue with 80% of the total diver population. 
3. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride out of the three city types. However, rural cities make up only 6.8% of the total revenue. 
4. Rural cities have only 2.6% of the total driver population with an average fare per driver of $$8.06 which is 12X the fare per driver of urban cities. This provides PyBer the opportunity to increase driver support in rural areas and further increase its revenue, invest in rural areas will provide more growth opportunity compared to the same investment in urban cities.

### Summary
Based on the analysis we have the following recommendations
1. Increase driver support in rural areas to capitalize on higher revenue per driver in rural areas. 
2. Increase surge pricing in urban areas to increase fare per driver. 
3. Analyse further analysis needs to understand the overall decline of fares for each city type in March. 
4. Analyse further the uptick in total revenues for Suburban cities in the middle of April.
